\begin{abstract}
Unplanned pregnancies often trigger marriage for unmarried cohabitating couples. I show that on average marriages in which a child appeared before or at the year of marriage are characterized with higher divorce probabilities and other outcomes suggesting lower marital quality. This association is robust to different ways of controlling for composition, and it is more pronounced for higher income and more educated couples. I argue that this pattern is consistent with household bargaining models, and the main driver of the result is unequal exposure of spouses to the childcare costs: since being single mother is a bad outcome for an educated female, she is more likely to agree to enter the marriages of lower quality. I estimate a lifecycle model with dynamic bargaining and fertility decisions to show how much of these differences is driven by household bargaining and how childcare costs contribute to observable divorce rates.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
%Understanding how people make marriage decisions and more generally how household structure is formed is crucial for analyzing labor market outcomes, assets accumulation, various dimensions of inequality and children development outcome. Most of existing studies, even ones that take household structure seriously, typically abstract from the fact that household structure is itself a choice variable. However, existing trends in marriage and divorce rates, increasing share of kids with unmarried parents and in blended families, and, especially, how different these trends are by income and racial groups --- this all suggests economic importance of household issues.

%In particular, economists know pretty little about how people decide on marriage and divorce, despite of the fact that these issues have lots of economic content. Stylized models describing marriage (and, in smaller extent, divorce) emerged in family economics, however most of them describe qualitative issues and do not deliver quantitative predictions that can be applied for analyzing policy or just understanding how different factors contribute to the recent changes. ...]

\subsection{Trends in Marriage And Divorce}


\subsection{Existing Results}


\section{Empirical Evidence}
The key empirical observation is association between marriage timing and divorce probabilities. Statistically, women who have their kids before they are married have significantly higher chance to be divorced. American Community Survey (ACS) data are suitable for establishing this fact only of particular subsample of women: most importantly, those who had no more than one marriage in their life. To re-confirm the patterns I additionally use Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data: they have smaller sample size but collect exact questions I care about.

\subsection{Defining Variables}

General strategy involves dividing sample in two groups: couples who had kids before their marriage ($K\to M$) and those who had kids after their marriage ($M\to K$). After this division I perform multiple comparisons of these groups: the main comparison is looking at divorce rates in several variations, few additional comparisons involve marriage inequality and outcomes of children.

Although the couples are the primary focus of the paper, the surveys I use look at individuals and households. Therefore I follow females rather than males: upon divorce, children are more likely to stay with mothers (share of single mothers in ACS is ..., single fathers ...). The timing I consider in the  most general form is (for females, given both events occurred): 
\[\Delta T = T^{\text{First child  is born}} - T^{\text{First marriage happened}},\]
where $T$ refers to moments of time. After that I define two groups (given $\Delta T$ is measured in years):
\begin{align*}&M\to K \Leftrightarrow \Delta T \in \{1,2,...\},\\
&K\to M \Leftrightarrow \Delta T \in \{...,-2,-1,0\},\end{align*}

In practice, I exclude observations with $\Delta T < -5$ or $\Delta T > 10$. The reason for the first one is mainly related to step-children: for the subsample when it can be tracked, share of step-children is becomes higher with more negative $\Delta  T$ in ACS, and having step-children that are relatively adult at the moment of marriage is a complex issue that is beyond the scope of the paper. See a note ... in the appendix about this. The reason for the second one is mainly data quality (...).

As the evidence is mainly cross-sectional, I refer to share of divorced people in a group as divorce rates. Unlike fertility, people can change their marriage status all the time, so there is no such thing as completed divorce rate, therefore I just use the share of people who ever had a divorce. More accurate measuring of divorce rates involves conditioning on age, however fixing age restricts the attention to a particular cohort, and pooling people of different ages together allows to think about more general population.


\subsection{Sample Restrictions}
\subsubsection{ACS data}
I take ACS samples of 2008--2016, as only they have variables concerning the duration of current marital status. Namely, people report the year of their most recent marriage. Fertility history is not observed perfectly: the survey reports age of the eldest child residing with individual. However, both of these variables can recover the timing of interest for relatively large subpopulation of females who:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Had exactly one marriage, so they are either married or divorced now (treating legally separated, spouse absent and widowed as married)
\item Have children present in household, with age of the eldest child below 18
\item Most likely reside with their eldest child judging by mother's age (I pick 21--40)
\end{enumerate}
%The last restriction can be relaxed, but it allows to track partners and children more clearly and also insures better quality of self-reported data.

The most important restriction here is being married once --- that means that people who re-marry drop out of sample. For instance, if it take longer to re-marry for the people who had kids before their first marriage, share of divorced people in the group $K\to M$ would be larger without differences in probability of their first marriage to dissolve. This concern can only partially be addressed with ACS data, but this is not an issue in SIPP. 


All mean and quantile calculations are performed using person weights.

\subsubsection{SIPP data}

I use wave 1 of 2014 SIPP. It it representative for the whole population, I use person weights in all calculations.

SIPP has much more detailed information on marital history and fertility: it explicitly asks about times of first marriage and first births, it also asks about multi-partner fertility. However it has substantially smaller sample size. For SIPP I relax the restrictions and consider all females who had at least one marriage and are of age 20--40 (treating married with spouses absent, separated and widowed as married), as their marital and fertility history is recovered perfectly.

%When dividing people by income, however, I have to further restrict attention to households that consist of mother + spouse/partner (if reported) + children. This creates some attrition especially for young people, but differences in defining household members are minimal between ACS and SIPP, so it is not likely that it creates an issue.

\subsection{Defining Income}
This part describes how I define income partitions in ACS. Shortly, I define income groups based on per hour income of working females, by excluding those who does not work from income considerations. In the appendix I try several 

For income percentiles I divide data on cells that consist of the US state, survey year (for ACS) and age group. I define age groups as 20--25, 26--30, 31--35, 36--40, and this classification is based on the age of female. Conditioning for year is done mainly to mitigate consequences of income decline in 2008. 

I drop cells with less than 100 observations (for instance, Vermont in ACS 2015 has 31 females in age group 20--25), this constitutes around [2\%] of all observations. 

\subsection{Raw Comparisons}
First, I compare divorce probabilities in cross-sections of people between $K\to M$ and $M\to K$ groups. See Table \ref{diff-raw} for this.

\subsection{Differences in Composition}
This section captures demographic and economic differences of K$\to$M and M$\to$K groups. Many factors could compute to the observable differences, here I quantify them and this justifies use of controls in the next part. I present these differences for ACS, SIPP tables are available in [Appendix ...]. For ACS, since M$\to$K and K$\to$M are defined only for subsample of people who were married once and have children present, I also compare this subsample with more general female population. See Table \ref{diff-contr} for the results.

\subsection{Statistical Tests and Controlling for Composition}

In this section I formally test differences in shares for different subgroups. I also attempt to control for composition using regressions with many fixed effects. I show that generally observable mean differences are not likely to be attributed to composition, and introducing various controls still leaves substantial part of the difference. 

In general, I perform the following exercise: I regress indicator of female being divorced on set of controls $X$ and dummy variable $\I(\text{K$\to$M})_i$. The specification I use is
\[D_i = \Delta \cdot \I(\text{K$\to$M})_i + X_i\gamma + \varepsilon_i.\]
Replacing $X_i$ with a constant corresponds to raw mean comparison described above. 

I report three possible estimates of $\Delta$:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Raw}, corresponding to differences in raw means in the previous part
\item \textbf{Controls}, where the regression includes dummies for ACS year, the US state, number of children, years after marriage, age of the eldest child, race and education group + 4th degree polynomial in woman's age
\item \textbf{Controls+income}, where the regression includes all of the above + dummies for income groups (low 30\%, mid 40\%, top 30\%) on a subsample where income equivalence scale is defined. This subsample is smaller, but has arguably better data quality.
\end{itemize}

See Table \ref{diff-contr} for the results.

\subsection{Additional Comparisons}

[I pick recently divorced people in ACS, I compare marriage durations for step and non-step children. I also check share of divorced in $M\to K$ and $K\to M$ given child's age and given marriage duration.]


\subsection{Intra-Household Allocations}

[I look at earnings, hours and LFP differences] [Grade retention depends on child's age, so need to compare given child's age]
\section{Model}

\input{model}

\section{Estimation Strategy}
I use techniques of indirect inference, extensively described, for instance, in [...] for estimation of the parameters. Shortly, I select parameters such that features of the real data are similar to the features of the data simulated from model. It is not entirely correct to call the procedure simulated method of moments, as some things that I match are not moments in econometric sense, however it has many similarities with simulated method of moments so I occasionally extend notion of moments to reflect any statistics derived from the data.

\subsection{Overview}
Full list of parameters involves many things:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fundamental parameters of income fluctuation model $(\beta,\sigma,R)$
\item Intra-household returns to scale $\rho_c$
\item Preferences for child's quality: $(\phi_0,\phi_1,\phi_2)$
\item Parameters for child's quality production function: CES power $\theta_k$ and labor shares by age $(\mu_y,\mu_s)$.
\item Transition probabilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Probability of pregnancy shock by age: $p^{\text{preg}}_t = \lambda^{\text{preg}}_0 - \lambda^{\text{preg}}_1\cdot t$ (2 parameters)
\item Probability of meeting a partner: $p^{\text{meet}}_t:$ piecewise linear function between $(p^{\text{meet}}_{21},p^{\text{meet}}_{27},p^{\text{meet}}_{34},p^{\text{meet}}_{40})$ (4 parameters)
\item Probability of re-entering marriage market and corresponding utility ``compensation'' $(p^{\text{out}},S)$. (2 parameters)
\item Probability that kids grow up (transition from $y$ to $s$): $p_s$ (1 parameter)
\end{itemize}
\item Age profiles of labor income by gender: $(a^f_0,a^f_1,a^f_2)$, $(a^m_0,a^m_1,a^m_2)$ (6 parameters)
\item Variance of shocks (6 parameters):
\begin{itemize}
\item Individual income shocks $\sigma^{z,f}$, $\sigma^{z,m}$.
\item Couple's surplus shocks $\sigma^{\psi}$
\item Couple's initial surplus $\sigma^{\psi_0}$
\item Assets and productivity of potential partner: $(\sigma^{z,p},\sigma^{a,p})$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Total number of parameters here is 31. Few additional choices involve time horizons, bounds for random walk variables and bounds for assets and $\theta$.



\subsection{Externally Set Parameters}
Length of the period is set to be 1 year, the model assumes people start their life with no assets at the age of $21$ and die deterministically at the age of $81$ (so $T = 30$). However, it assumes that fertility status can change only till age of 40 ($T_f = 19$) and marriage status till age of 50 ($T_m = 29$). It also assumes that after the age of 60 people retire and get $b = 0.4$ [as in Sommers, 2014] of their income at age of 60 (so no transitions happen). I stop simulations at the age of 50. 

Following standard approach in literature, I fix $\sigma = 1.5$, $R = 1.03$ and $\beta = 1/R$. Also, following estimates of Voena (2014) I set $\rho_c = 0.23$. 

I borrow age profiles from $(a^f_0,a^f_1,a^f_2)$, $(a^m_0,a^m_1,a^m_2)$ and variances of income shocks $\sigma^{z,f}$, $\sigma^{z,m}$ from Low et al 2018 [This will be replaced by my own estimates from SIPP].

I also externally estimate $\sigma^{z,p}$ as variance of (unpredicted part of) log-difference in spouses earnings, see Appendix \ref{partearn} for this. Based on this calculations I set $\sigma^{z,p} = 0.8$. As I both do not have good assets data and do not aim to replicate assets distribution, I set $\sigma^{a,p} = \sigma^{z,p}$.

I also set $p_s = \frac14$ to roughly reflect that children go to school on average at 6 and to pre-school few years earlier and this should correspond to a change in childcare costs structure.

In the part with assets, I assume savings can be between 0 and 20 times average labor income in the beginning of life. This bar in pretty low, but it is enough to create reasonable assets variation at the moment most of marriage decisions are made: say, median assets-to-income ratio at 30 is around 1 [see ...]. 

\subsection{Estimated Parameters}
Out of 31, 15 parameters are set externally, so I am left with $16$ parameters to estimate: child's parameters $(\phi_0,\phi_1,\phi_2)$, child quality production parameters $(\theta_k,\mu_y,\mu_a)$, variances of initial marriage surplus and its innovations $(\sigma^{\psi_0},\sigma^{\psi})$, meeting probability parameters $(p^{\text{meet}}_{21},p^{\text{meet}}_{27},p^{\text{meet}}_{34},p^{\text{meet}}_{40})$, pregnancy probability parameters $(\lambda^{\text{preg}}_0,\lambda^{\text{preg}}_1)$, transition out of being single mother parameters $p^{\text{out}}$, $S$. Unfortunately, all of them interact and as the model is highly stylized but involves many choices, they cannot be estimated externally. 

Conceptually, they can be split onto following groups:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Unplanned pregnancy probabilities are pinned down by share of $K\to M$ females at ages 25 and 35, as well as share of planned births in total population
\item Meeting probabilities and $\sigma^{\psi_0}$ are pinned down by shares of never married females people at 25, 35, share of females with one marriage at 40 (relevant to capture chances of re-marrying) and shares of never married at 30 for high and low income groups.
\item Childcare production function is recovered by ratio of time spent with kids by couple's income (pins down elasticity of substitution), average share of money spent on kids (captures ``average'' $\mu$) and ratio of time spent by child's age (captures difference between $\mu_a$ and $\mu_y$)
\item  Preferences for kids are captured by share of childless females by age of 25, 30, 35 (general scale), share of childless females for low and high income at 30 $\phi_1$. Luxury good parameter $\phi_2$ is pinned down by ratio of amounts of money spent on kids between 75 and 25 income quantiles.
\item Variance of innovation to marriage surplus is mainly pinned down by share of divorced people by age (25, 35, 40) and income groups (at 30).
\item Transition out of single mothers is captured by share of never married single mothers at 25 (picks $S$) and share of divorced women with kids at 30 (picks $p^{\text{out}}$).
\end{enumerate}
On top of it, I use shares of divorced people for $K\to M$ and $M \to K$ at 40 as additional targets that are affected by mixture of parameters described above.

I additionally impose the following constraints: share of rejected marital offers is within $[0.05,0.95]$ and average share of time spent on kids is below $0.8$. [Both of these constraints are non-binding in the solution I found, although turning them off occasionally may lead to implausible solutions.]

\subsection{Alternative Income Partitions\label{inc-part}}

Defining income groups in cross-sectional comparisons is no trivial, as income is endogenous to household's composition that is the main object of study here. I in this section I build several altrenative income partitions and argue that qualitatively pattern I care about holds for variety of definitions, although exact numbers may differ quite a lot.



\subsubsection{Equivalence Scale}

Following development and household literature, when dividing people by income group I use total household income adjusted by OECD equivalence scale. The scale assigns weight 1 to the household head, 0.5 to spouse and 0.3 to each child.

As I use the household income as the main variable of interest, I have to restrict attention to couples that live by themselves and single females with children. I do this both for ACS and SIPP, and as definition of households wary a little, this may drop out slightly different groups of people.

Formally,for income considerations I take a subsample of females who is marked as household's head or head's spouse, and who do not have any people living in household other than their spouse/unmarried partner and their children. This, for instance, excludes multigenerational household and people living with roommates, as total household's income may not be a relevant thing for some types of household composition. I cannot define income equivalence scale for more complicated living arrangements, although there are different scales that allow to do this.

To mitigate selectivity, I compute income percentiles in all sample of females with household composition mentioned above, regardless of their marriage and fertility status. I use total family income as the key variable. To mitigate misreporting I drop observations with total yearly family income below $\$4000$ for ACS (that is about a third of federal the poverty level) or monthly income below $\$300$ for SIPP.
